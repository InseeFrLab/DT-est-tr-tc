 abstract = {Socioeconomic indicators have long been used by official statistical agencies to analyze and assess the current stage at which the economy stands via the application of linear filters used in conjunction with seasonal adjustment procedures. In this study, we propose a new set of symmetric and asymmetric weights that offer substantial gains in real-time by providing timely and more accurate information for detecting short-term trends with respect to filters commonly applied by statistical agencies. We compare the new filters to the classical ones through application to indicators of the US economy, which remains the linchpin of the global economic system. To assess the superiority of the proposed filters, we develop and evaluate explicit tests of the null hypothesis of no difference in revision accuracy of two competing filters. Furthermore, asymptotic and exact finite-sample tests are proposed and illustrated to assess if two compared filters have equal probabilities of failing to detect turning points at different time horizons after their occurrence. }

  abstract={Estimation of signals at the current boundary of time series is an important task in many practical applications. In order to apply the symmetric filter at current time, model-based approaches typically rely on forecasts generated from a time series model in order to extend (stretch) the time series into the future. In this paper we analyze performances of concurrent filters based on TRAMO and X-12-ARIMA for business survey data and compare the results to a new efficient estimation method which does not rely on forecasts. It is shown that both model-based procedures are subject to heavy model misspecification related to false unit root identification at frequency zero and at seasonal frequencies. Our results strongly suggest that the traditional modelbased approach should not be used for problems involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as e.g. the determination of concurrent filters.},

The real-time signal extraction problem is formulated as a multivariate linear prediction problem, the optimal solution is presented in terms of a known model, and multivariate direct filter analysis is proposed to address the more typical situation where the process’ model is unknown. It is shown how general constraints – such as level and time shift constraints – can be imposed on a concurrent filter in order to guarantee that real-time estimates have requisite properties. The methodology is applied to petroleum and construction data.},

Now continuous estimates at endpoints are achievable. Under given conditions the use of those quite different weighting functions at an interior point is equivalent. At a boundary point the use of dierent methods will lead to different estimates. It is also shown that the optimal weighting function at the endpoints is a natural extension of one of the optimal weighting functions in the interior. Furthermore, it is shown that the most well known boundary kernels proposed in the literature can be generated by local polynomial regression using corresponding weighting functions. The proposals are particularly useful, when one-side smoothing or de- tection of change points in nonparametric regression are considered.},

Two prediction methods are considered: best linear unbiased prediction and best linear biased prediction where the bias is time invariant. The properties of these end filters are determined.

        Abstract = {This paper establishes the conditions under which the generalised least squares estimator of the regression parameters is equivalent to the weighted least squares estimator. The equivalence conditions have interesting applications in local polynomial regression and kernel smoothing. Specifically, they enable to derive the optimal kernel associated with a particular covariance structure of the measurement error, where optimality has to be intended in the Gauss-Markov sense. For local polynomial regression it is shown that there is a class of covariance structures, associated with non-invertible moving average processes of given orders which yield the Epanechnikov and the Henderson kernels as the optimal kernels.},

abstract = {The evaluation of economic data and the monitoring of the economy is often concerned with an assessment of the mid- and long-term dynamics of time series (trend and/or cycle). Frequently, one is interested in the most recent estimate of a target signal, a so-called real-time estimate. Unfortunately, real-time signal extraction is a difficult estimation problem that involves linear combinations of possibly infinitely many multi-step ahead forecasts of a series. Here, we address the performances of real-time designs by proposing a generic direct filter approach. We decompose the ordinary mean squared error into accuracy, timeliness and smoothness error components, and we propose a new tradeoff between these competing terms, the so-called ATS-trilemma. This formalism enables us to derive a general class of optimization criteria that allow the user to address specific research priorities, in terms of the accuracy, timeliness and smoothness properties of the corresponding concurrent filter. We illustrate the new methods through simulations, and present an application to Indian industrial production data.},
